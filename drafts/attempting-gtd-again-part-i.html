		<div><div class="section" id="history">
<h2>History</h2>
<p>I first read about GTD soon after I started my first job out of school.
I read the book as well as some websites/blogs.  This was around 2005 or 2006.
I tried to make it work but it didn't stick.  I am not positive what the
problem was.  It might have been that I didn't fully understand it or maybe
I failed to find a system that worked the way I did.  There was too much
friction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trying-again">
<h2>Trying Again</h2>
<p>My work email inbox (Outlook) was overflowing.  I had anywhere between 100 and
300 emails in there.  Most of them required a response even though I hadn't
looked at them in many months.  I was using my inbox as a TODO list and nothing
was getting done.  At the beginning of the year I started reading GTD again
and decided to give it another try.  I am hoping this different and I am
optimistic that it will be. I have a better understanding of how I work
and what the requirements of any system I put in place are.</p>
<div class="section" id="current-system">
<h3>Current System</h3>
<div class="section" id="inboxes">
<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<p>The first thing I tried to do when restarting GTD this time was to identify all
of the &quot;Inboxes&quot; that I have. This includes the obvious ones such as all of my
email inboxes (work and personal). It also includes voicemails on my phones
(work and personal), live phone calls, teleconferences and other meetings,
project work plans, and so on.</p>
<p>Once I had the list of inboxes, I tried to figure out how to minimize them.
Fewer inboxes means fewer places to remember to check of new projects and
action items.</p>
<div class="section" id="phone-calls">
<h5>Phone Calls</h5>
<p>When I get a phone call and I need to take notes or record action items,
I try to create a new note in Evernote to record that information.
I have an Evernote notebook called Inbox where these types of notes go.
There was no way to get rid of this inbox, I can't stop taking phone calls.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voicemail">
<h5>Voicemail</h5>
<p>I have started to forward my office phone to my cell phone, always. This has a
couple of advantages.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Reduces the number of inboxes by 1 since all of my voicemails will end up on my cell phone.</li>
<li>I use Google Voice so all of the voicemails will get translated to text and texted to me as well as show up in my email.</li>
</ol>
<p>So far the only problem with this has been my cell phone headset.  A headset
is mandatory for me because I am on the phone a lot. I didn't want a bluetooth
headset because I didn't want to have to charge yet another device. The first
headset I bought was one with an inline microphone.  People on the other end
sometimes had a hard time hearing me, depending on how the microphone was
positioned.  I have just ordered another headset, this one with a boom
microphone.  Hopefully it turns out better.</p>
<p>Finally, I need to go into Google Voice and set up my voicemail so people know
that they have reached the right person.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="meetings">
<h5>Meetings</h5>
<p>This one is similar to Phone Calls. For each meeting that I need to record information,
and that should be all of them I am invited to or I shouldn't have been invited, I create
a new note in Evernote.  Again, this note goes into my Evernote inbox.</p>
<p>The meeting itself is scheduled using Outlook for work meetings and Google Calendar for
personal appointments. There isn't much you can do about meetings other than make
sure you really need to attend and decline the request if you don't.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="paper">
<h5>Paper</h5>
<p>This is a wide ranging category which includes anything from junk mail to company newsletters.
This category is also one that I haven't tamed yet, currently, my desk is serving as my inbox.
I have added a project to my GTD system to set up a physical inbox for my home and work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="email">
<h5>Email</h5>
<p>I saved the biggest, nastiest, and stinkyest inbox for last. Lots has been written about Email,
why it sucks, and different ways to keep it under control. Unfortunately, I would be fired if I
put up the &quot;NOT HOME&quot; sign on my email, so I have to find some way to deal with it.</p>
<p>As I said above, my company uses Outlook as our Email/Calendaring/Contacts system.  I use Gmail
as my personal email system.</p>
<div class="section" id="personal-email">
<h6>Personal Email</h6>
<p>This is one area where I don't have a complete system figured out yet. I am limping by using
the great filtering, labeling, archiving, and search features of Gmail. This is also a
project that I have entered in my system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="work-email">
<h6>Work Email</h6>
<p>Work email is an interesting beast. We have to use PST files to store archived emails. Typically,
these PST files are stored on our hard drives. Some people do put them on a network drive, but
I am not one of them. I have had problems with crashes and general slowness when trying to access
a PST file stored on the network.</p>
<p>My current setup is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Inbox:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">My Inbox is stored on the Exchange server and is therefore also accessible on my phone
and via the outlook web interface</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I currently have 2 subfolders of my Inbox: Waiting-For and Response-Required</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Waiting-For</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This folder is used to keep track of emails that I have sent where I am asking for
information or I have delegated a task to someone else</li>
<li>I have the folder set to &quot;Show total number of items&quot; in its properties</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Response-Required</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This folder is used to keep all of the emails that I have to respond to</li>
<li>I have the folder set to &quot;Show total number of items&quot; in its properties</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Archive PSTs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I have Rules set up to copy every email I send or recieve to a PST file.</li>
<li>I rotate the PST file where my emails get archived once they reach about 4GB</li>
<li>I use these PST files in a similar (but limited) way to how Gmail handles archiving email</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Active Project PST:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I have a single PST file that I use to store project related emails</li>
<li>Each client I work with has a folder in this PST</li>
<li>Each project I am working on has a folder under the corresponding client folder</li>
<li>I manually move all project specific email to the correct project folder after it makes it
out of my Inbox (and its subfolders)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
