<h2>History</h2>
<p>I first read about GTD soon after I started my first job out of school.
I read the book as well as some websites/blogs.  This was around 2005 or 2006.
I tried to make it work but it didn't stick.  I am not positive what the
problem was.  It might have been that I didn't fully understand it or maybe
I failed to find a system that worked the way I did.  There was too much
friction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trying-again">
<h2>Trying Again</h2>
<p>My work email inbox (Outlook) was overflowing.  I had anywhere between 100 and
300 emails in there.  Most of them required a response even though I hadn't
looked at them in many months.  I was using my inbox as a TODO list and nothing
was getting done.  At the beginning of the year I started reading GTD again
and decided to give it another try.  I am hoping this different and I am
optimistic that it will be. I have a better understanding of how I work
and what the requirements of any system I put in place are.</p>
<div class="section" id="current-system">
<h3>Current System</h3>
<div class="section" id="inboxes">
<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<p>The first thing I tried to do when restarting GTD this time was to identify all
of the &quot;Inboxes&quot; that I have. This includes the obvious ones such as all of my
email inboxes (work and personal). It also includes voicemails on my phones
(work and personal), live phone calls, teleconferences and other meetings,
project work plans, and so on.</p>
<p>Once I had the list of inboxes, I tried to figure out how to minimize them.
Fewer inboxes means fewer places to remember to check of new projects and
action items.</p>
<div class="section" id="voicemail">
<h5>Voicemail</h5>
<p>I have started to forward my office phone to my cell phone, always. This has a
couple of advantages.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Reduces the number of inboxes by 1 since all of my voicemails will end up on my cell phone.</li>
<li>I use Google Voice so all of the voicemails will get translated to text and texted to me as well as show up in my email.</li>
</ol>
<p>So far the only problem with this has been my cell phone headset.  A headset
is mandatory for me because I am on the phone a lot. I didn't want a bluetooth
headset because I didn't want to have to charge yet another device. The first
headset I bought was one with an inline microphone.  People on the other end
sometimes had a hard time hearing me, depending on how the microphone was
positioned.  I have just ordered another headset, this one with a boom
microphone.  Hopefully it turns out better.</p>
<p>Finally, I need to go into Google Voice and set up my voicemail so people know
that they have reached the right person.</p>
