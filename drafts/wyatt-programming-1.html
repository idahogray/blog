		<div><p>Wyatt has shown interest in programming computers. I saw a tweet or google+ post
this week (sorry I couldn't find it again) where a father had written out
a program on a white board for his daughter to type in and run. I thought
this was a really great way to get started.</p>
<p>I have KTurtle installed on my
desktop at home and thought that would be a good way to get started. We have
played with Scratch a little bit but it was still a little old for him.</p>
<p>I opened one of the example programs and wrote it out on piece of paper.
Wyatt and I worked together, with him at the keyboard, to type it in.
He then ran it. Of course it didn't work the first time, what program does.
So we started debugging. I read every character in the program and he checked
to make sure his program matched. He still gets confused about some letters
so I helped him out a little bit. We got it to run!</p>
<p>Next, we modified the program to make the turtle draw a different shape.
I asked if he was interested in doing more of this and he said he was.
I told him that I would print out a program for him to type in every day
before I go to work. He would type it out and tell me what the turtle
drew.</p>
<p>I did the first one last night. The turtle drew a triangle and then wrote
the word &quot;triangle&quot; underneath it. Here is the program.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
reset
repeat 3 {
    forward 100
    turnleft 120
}

go 130, 200
print &quot;triangle&quot;

go 0, 0
</pre>
<p>I really like this exercise for a number of reasons.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Wyatt gets to learn the letters of the alphabet</li>
<li>Wyatt gets to learn the keys on the keyboard</li>
<li>Wyatt get introduced to logic, programming, and problem solving</li>
</ol>
<p>I think #3 is probably the most important. I know that problem solving
is one of the most important things in my job. People who can think
through a problem, figure out what is causing it, and fix it are
extremely valuable people.</p>
<p>I can't wait to get Ava going on this as well!</p>
