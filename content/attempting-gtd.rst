:summary: A description of my current system for implementing GTD

History
-------
I first read about GTD soon after I started my first job out of school.
I read the book as well as some websites/blogs.  This was around 2005 or 2006.
I tried to make it work but it didn't stick.  I am not positive what the 
problem was.  It might have been that I didn't fully understand it or maybe
I failed to find a system that worked the way I did.  There was too much
friction.

Trying Again
------------
My work email inbox (Outlook) was overflowing.  I had anywhere between 100 and
300 emails in there.  Most of them required a response even though I hadn't 
looked at them in many months.  I was using my inbox as a TODO list and nothing
was getting done.  At the beginning of the year I started reading GTD again
and decided to give it another try.  I am hoping this different and I am
optimistic that it will be. I have a better understanding of how I work
and what the requirements of any system I put in place are.
