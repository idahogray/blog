:summary: A list of my goals for 2014

I don't like the idea of new years resolutions but I do think this is a good 
oppportunity to set some goals for the new year. I am not sure if that is
different than resolutions, but it is in my head.

Goals for 2014
--------------

* Continue to get as close to "Paleo" eating as possible in order to keep
  improving my health
* Add in "Paleo" exercises to my routine
* Travel less (Only making Gold Medallion on Delta in 2014 is the goal)
* Build things with my kids
* Spend more time with Amy, just the two of us
* Finish my garage automation project
* Do stuff around the house without Amy asking me to
* Walk Bella at least 3 times a week, even when the weather is bad/cold
* Reduce the amount of gluten my kids eat
