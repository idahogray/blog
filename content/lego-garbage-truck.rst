:summary: Wyatt did his first "Big Boy" Lego Set

Nonna_ and Grandpa_ bought Wyatt a garbage truck lego set for Easter this year. Wyatt and I
started building it on Thursday night.  We only made it a few pages into the
instruction book.

He did really well looking for the pieces that matched the picture in the
instruction book. We played games like "You're getting Warmer" to help him
find the pieces. He pretended his arm was a crane when he found the pieces.

I had a lot of fun building it and I think he did too. This kit was a little
above his age but he stuck with it. It took 3 days to finish it and he loves it.

He played with it quite a bit today. He is a little rough with it and it 
comes apart sometimes. He repeats what I told him about Legos: "The good
thing about Legos is that you can always put it back together".
