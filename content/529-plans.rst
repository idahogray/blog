:summary: We finally set up 529 plans for the kids

Amy and I have been talking about setting up college funds for Wyatt and Ava
for a while now.  As part of our New Years resolutions, we decided to make it
happen this year.  We set up a visit with a financial planner and he guided us
through the process.  As of tonight, both Wyatt and Ava have 529 Plans set
up through the Missouri MOST program.

Both accounts currently have a $0 balance but that is just until we can move
some money from their savings accounts.

Next on the list: set up automatic deposit from my paycheck to their new
accounts.

Side Note
---------
According to the software the financial planner used, one year of college for
the kids is projected to cost $66,000 or more.  That is insane.  I guess that
is why we are saving now.
