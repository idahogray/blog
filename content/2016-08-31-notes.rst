:summary: Some notes from today

Today
-----

I did some more research on |sdn| today. I learned that my suspicion was correct
in that if a port fails the switch would have to request a new flow from the controller.
This would significantly increase the failover time, I read some examples of 300ms.
Obviously this is too slow for protection applications and is even slower than
|rstp|.

However, version 1.1 of the OpenFlow standard introduced the idea of *Groups*.
According to this article_,
OpenFlow Fast Failover groups are specifically meant to address this issue.
The article says the failover times are not defined by the standard but
are meant to be faster than having to request a new flow from the controller.

I believe this is how `SEL <http://selinc.com>`_ is achieving :math:`100\mu S` 
failover times with their |sdn| switch product.

.. |sdn| replace:: :abbr:`SDN (Software Defined Networking)`
.. |rstp| replace:: :abbr:`RSTP (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol)`
