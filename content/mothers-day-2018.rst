I am missing (another) Mother's day this year due to work.
It isn't the first one I have missed and it probably won't be the last.
Work finished a little early today so I wanted to take some time
and write a note to Amy.

Amy, I want you to know that you are appreciated. You work harder
than anyone I know. You are always on duty. This is doubly true
because I am gone a lot for work. I know that puts a lot of pressure
on you. Wyatt has baseball, Ava has soccer, you work at the library,
grocery shop, keep the house from burning down, and on, and on, and on.

Our kids are growing into great people. They are kind, considerate,
trustworthy, teammates, intelligent, and hard-working. This is all because
of you! You set a great example for them and you guide them into making
the right decisions. 

I love you.

Keith
