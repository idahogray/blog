Introduction
------------

`SEL <http://selinc.com>`_ is introducing a new networking product for the 
utility market based on |sdn|.
The fact that this technology is making it into the electric utility 
industry is pretty amazing considering how new it is.

A recent `article <https://selinc.com/company/news/116217/>`_ sparked some
conversation inside my group at work. I decided I should do some more
research. I started reading about |sdn| by purchasing 
`Software Defined Networking with OpenFlow <https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/software-defined-networking-openflow>`_.
This book served as a good introduction to |sdn| and using a
simulation platform called `Mininet <http://mininet.org/>`_.

One question I still have is how to achieve fast failovers with |sdn|.

I plan to keep researching this and playing with the simulations.

.. |sdn| replace:: :abbr:`SDN (Software Defined Networking)`
