:summary: A description of How I Work when commissioning a SCADA project

I would like to describe how I work when commissioning a substation SCADA project. 
This post describes the software that I use during commissioning.

NovaTech OrionLX Communications Processor
-----------------------------------------

Most of my commissioning work over the last few years has involved the NovaTech Orion family of communications processors.
Therefore, this post will describe my work with that equipment.  Some of the 
content could be applied to other processors, but not all of it.
