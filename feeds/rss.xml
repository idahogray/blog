This was the first time for both of them.
They both had a lot of fun and so did &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/104461654563341959829"&gt;Amy&lt;/a&gt; and I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ignore my score. My excuse is that I was helping Wyatt and Ava and therefore
not able to concentrate on my own game.&lt;/p&gt;

Wyatt and I
started building it on Thursday night.  We only made it a few pages into the
instruction book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8533/8604852882_9c53b485ec.jpg" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8533/8604852882_9c53b485ec.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did really well looking for the pieces that matched the picture in the
instruction book. We played games like &amp;quot;You're getting Warmer&amp;quot; to help him
find the pieces. He pretended his arm was a crane when he found the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun building it and I think he did too. This kit was a little
above his age but he stuck with it. It took 3 days to finish it and he loves it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/8604854386_7c3c769cba.jpg" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/8604854386_7c3c769cba.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He played with it quite a bit today. He is a little rough with it and it
comes apart sometimes. He repeats what I told him about Legos: &amp;quot;The good
thing about Legos is that you can always put it back together&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

for a while now.  As part of our New Years resolutions, we decided to make it
happen this year.  We set up a visit with a financial planner and he guided us
through the process.  As of tonight, both Wyatt and Ava have 529 Plans set
up through the Missouri MOST program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both accounts currently have a $0 balance but that is just until we can move
some money from their savings accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list: set up automatic deposit from my paycheck to their new
accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="side-note"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Side Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the software the financial planner used, one year of college for
the kids is projected to cost $66,000 or more.  That is insane.  I guess that
is why we are saving now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
