I saw a tweet or google+ post
this week (sorry I couldn't find it again) where a father had written out
a program on a white board for his daughter to type in and run. I thought
this was a really great way to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have KTurtle installed on my
desktop at home and thought that would be a good way to get started. We have
played with Scratch a little bit but it was still a little old for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened one of the example programs and wrote it out on piece of paper.
Wyatt and I worked together, with him at the keyboard, to type it in.
He then ran it. Of course it didn't work the first time, what program does.
So we started debugging. I read every character in the program and he checked
to make sure his program matched. He still gets confused about some letters
so I helped him out a little bit. We got it to run!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we modified the program to make the turtle draw a different shape.
I asked if he was interested in doing more of this and he said he was.
I told him that I would print out a program for him to type in every day
before I go to work. He would type it out and tell me what the turtle
drew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the first one last night. The turtle drew a triangle and then wrote
the word &amp;quot;triangle&amp;quot; underneath it. Here is the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;reset
repeat 3 {
    forward 100
    turnleft 120
}

go 130, 200
print &amp;quot;triangle&amp;quot;

go 0, 0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this exercise for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wyatt gets to learn the letters of the alphabet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wyatt gets to learn the keys on the keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wyatt get introduced to logic, programming, and problem solving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think #3 is probably the most important. I know that problem solving
is one of the most important things in my job. People who can think
through a problem, figure out what is causing it, and fix it are
extremely valuable people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to get Ava going on this as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Session 1 Agenda and Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Introduction to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc"&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt; boards and software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uno&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leonardo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Install the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software"&gt;Arduino Software&lt;/a&gt; in Windows or Linux&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Connect the Arduino to the PC and make sure the software can communicate with it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the Leonardo from the list of boards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the correct serial port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the blink example from the menus, compile it, and send it to the Arduino&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure there are no errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the onboard LED connected to pin 13 is blinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Visually insped the code and describe how it works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declaring constants (different than what is in the examples)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Use an external LED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wire up and external LED with the correct resistor value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alter the Arduino code to choose the correct pin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile and send to the Arduino&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify the LED blinks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Play with the code a little bit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the LED stay on longer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the LED stay off longer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the LED blink faster with equal on/off times (duty cycle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Talk about Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) (A form of analog output)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built in function: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogWrite"&gt;analogWrite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Use PWM to fade an LED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Fade example from the Arduino IDE menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspect the code to see what it does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the led pin correctly in the code for how the LED is connected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile and send the code to the Arduino&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify the LED fades in and out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Play with the code a little bit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it take longer to fade in and out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it fade faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it so it only fades out and then goes immediately to full brightness again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Gina and
Kevin were talking about email and getting to Inbox Zero and so on. One of their
comments was that email fails because it is a TODO list that other people can
add items to. This is not the first time I have heard this and I don't know
who originally said it, I couldn't find it in quick Google search. They
also made a comment about training other people that emailing you does not
mean an immediate response is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comment got me thinking, again, about how I use email at work. I currently
have about 71 emails that I feel like I need to respond to. This weighs on
me and I can never feel like I am caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode got me thinking about sending an automatic response to incoming
emails. Something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Thank you for your email. If this email contains a task you would like
me to complete, I would appreciate it if you would call me. This would allow
us to properly discuss the task, its schedule, my availability, and
possible alternatives if those items don't line up.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with something like this is that I am an Engineering consultant.
We make money by being responsive to clients. The more responsive we can be,
the more likely we are to get repeat business and repeat business is the best
kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a good compromise would be to have this response be sent to anyone
inside my company but not to our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am just not sure how my peers and managers would respond to something like
this. So much of our business is done over email that this response may appear
to be in bad form. I think an argument could be made that a response like this
is more honest and will possibly generate more realistic discussions about
tasks and schedules than the current alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to hear any reader's thoughts, especially from those in similar
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

Wyatt and I
started building it on Thursday night.  We only made it a few pages into the
instruction book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8533/8604852882_9c53b485ec.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did really well looking for the pieces that matched the picture in the
instruction book. We played games like &amp;quot;You're getting Warmer&amp;quot; to help him
find the pieces. He pretended his arm was a crane when he found the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun building it and I think he did too. This kit was a little
above his age but he stuck with it. It took 3 days to finish it and he loves it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/8604854386_7c3c769cba.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He played with it quite a bit today. He is a little rough with it and it
comes apart sometimes. He repeats what I told him about Legos: &amp;quot;The good
thing about Legos is that you can always put it back together&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

for a while now.  As part of our New Years resolutions, we decided to make it
happen this year.  We set up a visit with a financial planner and he guided us
through the process.  As of tonight, both Wyatt and Ava have 529 Plans set
up through the Missouri MOST program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both accounts currently have a $0 balance but that is just until we can move
some money from their savings accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list: set up automatic deposit from my paycheck to their new
accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="side-note"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Side Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the software the financial planner used, one year of college for
the kids is projected to cost $66,000 or more.  That is insane.  I guess that
is why we are saving now.&lt;/p&gt;
