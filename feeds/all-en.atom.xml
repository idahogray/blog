oppportunity to set some goals for the new year. I am not sure if that is
different than resolutions, but it is in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="goals-for-2014"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals for 2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to get as close to &amp;quot;Paleo&amp;quot; eating as possible in order to keep
improving my health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add in &amp;quot;Paleo&amp;quot; exercises to my routine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel less (Only making Gold Medallion on Delta in 2014 is the goal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build things with my kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more time with Amy, just the two of us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish my garage automation project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do stuff around the house without Amy asking me to&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't go to bed with any dirty dishes in the sink (hand-wash if needed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk Bella at least 3 times a week, even when the weather is bad/cold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the amount of gluten my kids eat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I don't want to use the typical PowerPoint for a number of reasons, none of
which are important to this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of the tutorial lends itself to having some animations.
I chose to use SVG images with animations because I had previously
chosen to use a web based presentation application.&lt;/p&gt;

Gina and
Kevin were talking about email and getting to Inbox Zero and so on. One of their
comments was that email fails because it is a TODO list that other people can
add items to. This is not the first time I have heard this and I don't know
who originally said it, I couldn't find it in quick Google search. They
also made a comment about training other people that emailing you does not
mean an immediate response is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comment got me thinking, again, about how I use email at work. I currently
have about 71 emails that I feel like I need to respond to. This weighs on
me and I can never feel like I am caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode got me thinking about sending an automatic response to incoming
emails. Something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Thank you for your email. If this email contains a task you would like
me to complete, I would appreciate it if you would call me. This would allow
us to properly discuss the task, its schedule, my availability, and
possible alternatives if those items don't line up.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with something like this is that I am an Engineering consultant.
We make money by being responsive to clients. The more responsive we can be,
the more likely we are to get repeat business and repeat business is the best
kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a good compromise would be to have this response be sent to anyone
inside my company but not to our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am just not sure how my peers and managers would respond to something like
this. So much of our business is done over email that this response may appear
to be in bad form. I think an argument could be made that a response like this
is more honest and will possibly generate more realistic discussions about
tasks and schedules than the current alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to hear any reader's thoughts, especially from those in similar
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

This was the first time for both of them.
They both had a lot of fun and so did &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/104461654563341959829"&gt;Amy&lt;/a&gt; and I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ignore my score. My excuse is that I was helping Wyatt and Ava and therefore
not able to concentrate on my own game.&lt;/p&gt;

Wyatt and I
started building it on Thursday night.  We only made it a few pages into the
instruction book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8533/8604852882_9c53b485ec.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did really well looking for the pieces that matched the picture in the
instruction book. We played games like &amp;quot;You're getting Warmer&amp;quot; to help him
find the pieces. He pretended his arm was a crane when he found the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun building it and I think he did too. This kit was a little
above his age but he stuck with it. It took 3 days to finish it and he loves it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/8604854386_7c3c769cba.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He played with it quite a bit today. He is a little rough with it and it
comes apart sometimes. He repeats what I told him about Legos: &amp;quot;The good
thing about Legos is that you can always put it back together&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

for a while now.  As part of our New Years resolutions, we decided to make it
happen this year.  We set up a visit with a financial planner and he guided us
through the process.  As of tonight, both Wyatt and Ava have 529 Plans set
up through the Missouri MOST program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both accounts currently have a $0 balance but that is just until we can move
some money from their savings accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list: set up automatic deposit from my paycheck to their new
accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="side-note"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Side Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the software the financial planner used, one year of college for
the kids is projected to cost $66,000 or more.  That is insane.  I guess that
is why we are saving now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
